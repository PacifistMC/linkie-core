#### Fork of `linkie-core` that's contains a few updates and changes.
Currently, the main feature the fork adds is a way to export multiple mappings in a single tiny file.

Note: 1.20.2+ doesn't have SRG mappings, in NeoForge mojmap is available at runtime.\
Not sure what Forge has though

TODO
- Check if Forge still has SRG mappings or did they also switch to mojmap at runtime?
